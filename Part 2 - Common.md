"Think ya getting away after that missy?"


The prick and his buddy stagger out of the inn. Prick has a jack of scaled armour over his doublet and a mid length dagger in his hand. His buddy holds a rope about two metres long in both hands and wears a hunter's leather armour. Looks like these assholes aren't going to take no for an answer.


As you draw your sword, Demonslayer, the two bastards rush at you. Side stepping: you avoid a dagger thrust to the rib cage. Your plate armour offers great protection but it is far from complete. Unfortunately the hunter catches you around the neck with his rope and drags you to your knees.


Everything starts to become fuzzy as your neck tightens under the rope's pressure. You reach for the rope with your free hand but it is no use, the hunter now stands behind: choking you with the rope. Before you can swing Demonslayer, the prick in the doublet is upon you again.


"Now, now. Why so fiesty, bitch?"


Suddenly a lightening bolt turns everything blindly bright. Prick's hair stands on end and begins to smell of ozone as he turns to track the bolt. The robed nerd from before stands at the inn door, book in one hand and another raised towards you. A hunter has you by the neck with a rope, a prick is rushing towards the lightening mage. 


Friend or foe, it is now your only chance to get out of this alive.


*You decide to ...*


  0. Kill them all.
  1. Attack the hunter.
  2. Attack the prick.
