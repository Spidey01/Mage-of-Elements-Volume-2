Unfortunately the house keeper didn't repair their rooftop very often and your steel plate wears you down. The roof gives way and you fall. The robbed Nerd grabs your hand and ends up laying prone: holding you by one forearm as your sword arm dangles by your side.

"Hey, help me!" he shouts at the ninja.

You look down and it turns out that it isn't a normal room below. You see a two story drop onto a glass table. Falling isn't looking so good for your health. But why would the Ninja help?

"Sheath that blade and then I'll help."

Before you know it the ninja woman has your other hand and along with the nerd: they haul you back onto the roof top.

"Wait, what the heck is happening here?" you ask.
"Yeah? Weren't you trying to kill us?" the Nerd asks with curiously stare.
"No, I was aiming for men at the Inn." says the Ninja.
"Well, I did almost shoot Mr. Mage but that was an accident."

The three of you decide to introduce yourselves.

"My name is Anko Yukari, for my people our family name comes first."
"Zum Kaz, we're backwards from you islanders of the east."
"Launa, just Launa. I'd say nice to meet you all but what the hell is going on?"

Zum Kaz, nerd extraordinare and mage speaks up first.

"In my case, I just figured Launa could use a hand at the bar. Those bastards were real pricks."
"And as for me, I just wanted a drink and a nap before moving on. Instead I got hit on at the bar and it snowballed."
"Curious, very curious indeed."

Yukari crosses her arms and continues.

"I came here on a mission seeking The Island of Divine Wind. A merchant swindled the local ruler the last time the island came overheard and contracted The Third Order to assassinate him in revenge. Asking around about the island's current wearabouts: I heard of a blonde sword maiden who also seeks the island. By the time that I reached the inn there were scarcely few women meeting any of the descriptions I was given."

Kaz rubs his head in confusion.

"What a coincidence. I've been seeking this floating island as well; we call it Breeze. My order has been researching its movements for years now but I was the first to set out to actually find it. Everyone else was too afraid of the Guardians of Breeze."

You look from Kaz to Yukari and smile. The party is formed and the quest lay ahead.

"Well, in my case: I heard there would be fine treasure. Problem is I don't really know where Breeze happens to be."
