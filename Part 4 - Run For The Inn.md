*You decide to run for the inn*

You grab the robbed Nerd's hand and book it for the inn. Bursting inside you head for the bar.

"Is there a back exit?"
"Yeah, it's in the back!"

You leap over the bar, dragging the flabbergasted nerd in your wake. Slamming the back door open you find yourself in a broom closet. There are boxes piled everywhere and a couple kegs of alcohol stacked.

"Screw it then. Let's hide!"

Together you quickly shuffle boxes around but there is no room to squeeze yourself between boxes and walls. luckily, you find a ladder behind a stack of boxes. You climb up to the roof.
