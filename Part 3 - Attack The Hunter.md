You decide to attack the hunter.


Pulling down on the rope with your free hand: you use swing your sword arm upwards and stab the hunter through the eye with Demonslayer. Quickly the rope goes slack and you're on your feet again. It is hard to breath and you feel like you will sound horrible for days but you are alive for the moment.


Another lightening bolt lashes out from the robed nerd's hand, catching the prick square in the chest. This bolt was much stronger and he goes down. As you retreive Demonslayer from his buddies face, a mysterious arrow zips past your ear, narrowly missing the nerd's knee as it sticks in the side of the Inn. There is no more time to waste.
