You throw Demonsalyer at the pricks back. It pierces the scale armour and juts out of his chest. He drops to his knees in a poll of blood, never to bother another woman again.


Before you know it: the robed nerd has taken a freak arrow to the knee. Suddenly a burst of arrows follow. Your only ally lays dying with several arrows to the neck and heart. You have no weapons left and there is still a rope around your neck.


Everything goes black as the hunter tightens the rope. You begin to lose concisnous and wonder if you will ever again wake to see the sun rise.


    *The End -- Bad.*
