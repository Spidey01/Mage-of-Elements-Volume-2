*You decide to run for the alley*

You grab the robbed Nerd's hand and book it for the alley. The alleyway is dark and narrow. You run.

"Hey, shouldn't I be in front?" asks the Nerd.
"Not unless you can conjure up plate armour!" you shout.

Nerd probably means well but push comes to shove: your steel cuirass will hold off arrows a lot better than his sweaty old robes. A magical barrier or whirlwind spell would be damned handy about now.

Seeing some boxes stacked by a short wall, you let go of the Nerd's hand, climb and jump up. Pulling yourself up to the roof, you stop to help Nerd up. He's probably spent his days in libraries and arcane rituals; you spent your days with a sword as often as you could. You're a far more athletic warrior type but can't use magic like the Nerd.
