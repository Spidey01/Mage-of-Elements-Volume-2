*You decide to leave quietly* without incident.


Leaving the beer mug at the bar, you stride out of the inn and make for your horse. As you try to leave, the prick tries grabbing your arm but you pull away and keep walking. It's not long before you're outside to where your horse is stabled. Schatten is softly enjoying her feed as you pat her apologetically. She won't have time to finish dinner thanks to the jerks at the bar.
