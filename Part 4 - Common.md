The inn's rooftop offers you a drastic change in position but no safety from what arrows may fly. You and the nerd run and leap roof top to roof top. Fortunately you grew up rambunctious and the roof tops are close enough together that the Nerd manages without falling.

Ahead of you appears a short woman with jet black hair. A small assassin's sized bow in hand, a sword jutting over one of her shoulders and a quiver of arrows over the over. Her red jumpsuit obviously has several weapons. She's clearly armed to the teeth.

You've got a shiny steel cuirass glinting in the moonlight, your trusty sword demon slayer, and a mage that obviously knows lighting bolt. It's time to decide.

  1. Charge the ninja
  2. Run like hell
