*You decide to attack the prick.*


You toss Demonslayer at the enemy's exposed back. It pierces the scale plate armour and leaves him dropping dead in a pool of blood. But there is still a rope around your neck and your only real weapon is now out of reach. The robed nerdÂ 


You feel a trickle of blood down your back as the rope goes slack. The hunter suddenly has an arrow sticking through his neck as he waddles off to die. Another burst of arrows and he is down for good. There is no more time to waste.
