*You decide to attack the prick.*


You toss Demonslayer at the enemy's exposed back. It pierces the scale plate armour and leaves him dropping dead in a pool of blood. But there is still a rope around your neck and your only real weapon is now out of reach. The robed nerdÂ stares flabbergasted; he should just be glad he's not covered in blood.


You feel a trickle of blood down your back as the rope goes slack. The hunter suddenly has an arrow sticking through his neck as he waddles off to die in the darkness. Another burst of arrows and he is down for good. There is no more time to waste.
