*You decide to be brash*

You deposit the empty stein on the bar and decide to be brash. With a swift kick to the jewels, the troublesome prick goes down in one blow. A second swift kick sends him toppling into his drunken buddy, Vanderpol.

You stride out of the inn, flicking another coin over your shoulder. You head for your horse. Schatten is softly enjoying her feed as you pat her apologetically. She won't have time to finish dinner.
