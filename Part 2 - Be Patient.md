You decide to be patient. Better to avoid causing a scene.

The prick slides one arm around your waist. You grit your teeth and resist the urge to kick him. He smells of urine and mead. You're not in the mood to be groped but wish to avoid a fight.


"Hey, leave the lady be!" calls a male voice from behind.


"Whatz it to ya? Piss off, nerd."


Glancing over your shoulder, you notice the speaker. He wears brown robes. Book in one hand, beer stein in the other. He means well but doesn't look like much help in a bar room brawl. This isn't going to go well by any means.
